# Breast-cancer-classification



Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenges against it’s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous). We ask you to complete the analysis of classifying these tumors using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

# WHY SVM 

SVMs perform well even in cases where the number of features is greater than the number of samples. In the case of breast cancer classification, there are typically many features (e.g., texture, perimeter, area, smoothness) that describe the tumors, and SVMs can handle this high-dimensional data effectively.

SVMs can handle both linear and non-linear classification tasks by using different kernel functions. They can transform the input space into a higher-dimensional space, where the data might be linearly separable. This allows SVMs to capture complex relationships between the features and the target variable.
